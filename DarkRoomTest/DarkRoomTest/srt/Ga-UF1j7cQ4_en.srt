1
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:21,385
Have we really broken up?

2
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:24,856
Have you really left?

3
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:31,739
I try calling, but you don't answer. 

4
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,489
I can't forget you,

5
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:40,424
I'm falling apart.

6
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:49,078
Don't be disappointed in me for being like this. 

7
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:56,850
Each day passes like tears,

8
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:05,556
Is your heart okay, my love?

9
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:10,208
Honey, oh Honey,

10
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,490
I miss you so much.

11
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:20,933
Whose heart is crying for you?

12
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:25,604
Honey, oh Honey,

13
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:32,501
Leave the sadness behind and live happily.

14
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:39,389
My loved one.

15
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:15,334
When I see a beautiful dress,

16
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:19,109
I keep thinking of you.

17
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:27,700
My heart feels like it's going to burst.

18
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:35,617
Each day passes like tears.

19
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:43,817
Are you truly okay, my love? 

20
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:48,461
Honey, oh Honey, 

21
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,116
I miss you so much.

22
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:59,688
Whose heart is crying for you?

23
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:03,943
Honey, oh Honey,

24
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:11,396
Leave the sadness behind and live happily.

25
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:17,853
My loved one.

26
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:23,707
Honey, oh Honey,

27
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:27,117
I miss you so much.

28
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:34,517
Don't cry in anyone's arms.

29
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,859
Honey, oh Honey,

30
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:45,970
Leave the sadness behind and live happily.

31
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:53,778
My loved one,

32
00:03:53,778 --> 00:04:05,321
The person I love.
